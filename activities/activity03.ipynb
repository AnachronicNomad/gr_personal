    ">   The goal of this activity is to get used to working with different metrics, the Christoffel symbols, and the geodesic equation in a simple setting: 2D flat space.  The geodesic equation in this setting should tell us what \"straight line\" means in our coordinate system.  While this definition is quite straight-forward in Cartesian coordinates, it is a bit more complex in polar coordinates. However, working with this equation in polar coordinates will solve our apparent problem for circular motion -- see notes from previous class. "

    ">   Figure 3 shows two straight lines in the 2D plane.  Path A goes through the origin, and is rather simple to parameterize: $r_A(t) = r_0 + vt$, $\\theta_A(t) = \\pi / 4$.  Verify that this line satisfies the polar-coordinate geodesic equation. \n",

    ">   Path B is more difficult to parameterize.  We can start with cartesian coordinates like: $x_B(t) = x_0 + vt$, $y_B(t) = d$.  Then, we can use the transformation equations between cartesian and polar: $x = r \\cos(\\theta)$, $y=r\\sin(\\theta)$.  That means that the correct parameterization for the Path B in polar coordinates is below:\n",
