    ">   The goal of this activity is to get the Equations of Motion for an orbiting body (near Earth) using the Schwarzschild metric, and analyze the behavior of the solution in the case of a circular orbit. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">   Remember, this problem is using General Relativity, so there does not need to be a force; gravity is a pseudo-force accounted for by the metric tensor itself. This part of the activity is sort of a continuation from last week. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">   We will also prepare for next class when we talk about _non-circular_ orbits.  Our goal today is to understand how we can show that in the Newtonian case (non-relativistic) the elliptical orbits are _closed in one trip around the Earth_."

In the movie Interstellar ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film))) the \"Miller's Planet\" orbits a black hole. It is said that the time difference between the surface and Earth (effectively infinitely far away) is 7 Earth hours per each 1 hour on Miller's planet.  If this is true, calculate the ratio $r_s / r$ for the orbit of Miller's planet. How close to the event horizon (in percent) is the orbit of Miller's planet? "
