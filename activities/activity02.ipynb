    ">   **Activity:**   Part of what we learned in class is pretty profound: two locally inertial frames can be _mutually non-inertial_.  This means that when viewed by the other observer each frame is non-inertial, but appears perfectly inertial when viewing within our own frame only. \n",
    ">   \n",
    ">   The reason this is profound is: \n",
    ">\n",
    ">   - a global definition of inertial frame seems to be lacking, and\n",
    ">   - no coordinate system that we've dealt with before seems to have this property. \n",
    "> \n",
    ">   Figure 2 shows a standard situation with a rotating frame. The frame attached to the merry-go-round (MGR) is clearly non-inertial from the perspective of the outside observer. However, from the perspective of an observer on the MGR, it is clearly discoverable that they themselves are in a non-inertial frame. \n",

    ">   This is very different from the situation we discussed in class. In that case, we had two frames whose internal observers are _absolutely_ sure they are in inertial frames, but they nevertheless judge each others' frame as non-inertial. "
